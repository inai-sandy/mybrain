# My Brain — polish pass

Module-by-module polish, run by `/polish-mybrain`.
For each module: read the code → plain-English brief → my weakness list → owner's real-use input →
file flat Linear issues → build + ship them → mark built.

## Module 10 + 1 — the delegation redesign (discussed 2026-07-21)

Not a polish — a redesign of Contacts & Reminders into a **delegation and follow-through system**,
agreed with the owner through 12 recorded decisions. The reminder stops being the thing; the **task**
becomes the thing, and the reminder is just how it gets chased.

The loop: **brief a person → tasks owned by them → chases that repeat until done → they reply or tick
their own shared page → agent marks it claimed → you confirm → chase stops.** Plus neglect reporting,
contact-tagged brain indexing, EMO briefing/closing by voice, and confirm/reject on the device.

Build order (dependencies first):

1. ✅ `BEA-1019` real task↔person links + `@` mentions — SHIPPED 2026-07-21
2. ✅ `BEA-1020` briefings — SHIPPED 2026-07-21
3. ✅ `BEA-1021` chases belong to a task, repeat until confirmed — SHIPPED 2026-07-21
4. ✅ `BEA-1024` agent marks the claimed task — SHIPPED 2026-07-21
5. ✅ `BEA-1025` review list (confirm / reject) — SHIPPED 2026-07-21
6. ✅ `BEA-1027` + `BEA-1028` the contact's shared short link, tick + note → review — SHIPPED 2026-07-21
7. ✅ `BEA-1029` delegated view · ✅ `BEA-1037` contact workspace — SHIPPED
8. ✅ `BEA-1022` promised dates · ✅ `BEA-1030` stalling digest · ✅ `BEA-1023` agent context — SHIPPED
9. ✅ `BEA-1031` brain indexing by contact — SHIPPED
10. ✅ `BEA-1032` EMO brief lane · ✅ `BEA-1033` EMO closing intent · ✅ `BEA-1034` cards by person — SHIPPED
11. ✅ `BEA-1035` device needs-you feed (server) — SHIPPED · ✅ `BEA-1036` Watch 0.5.0 — SHIPPED 2026-07-22, verified on-wrist by the owner
12. ✅ `BEA-1026` promise ordering — SHIPPED · ✅ `BEA-1038` closed as a CORRECTION (the premise was wrong)

**All 20 shipped (2026-07-21/22), plus follow-ups BEA-1039 (chase markers, AI tidy, pagination,
chase buttons) and BEA-1040 (brain dump routes tasks to the right person).** Watch 0.5.0 note: the
firmware agent published to OTA against instructions while reporting it hadn't — caught in
verification, rolled back, then kept after the owner verified 0.5.0 on his wrist and briefed
Madhuri by voice as the first real use.

Owner's recorded decisions: one owner + `@`others · briefings stack per contact · review inbox ·
chase repeats until confirmed · delegated work off the personal board · neglect = 3 chases with no
reply → daily digest · agent replies free but "done" needs the owner · brain gets tasks + briefings +
a rolling per-person summary (not raw chat) · briefing from wrist, phone and typed · one combined
WhatsApp message per person · a promised date drops the chase to once daily, never pauses · every
contact will have WhatsApp · shared page shows open **and** completed, tick + note, always approved.

## Standing pile (not part of the walk)

- **audit-sweep backlog** — 32 open findings from the 2026-07-04 read-through (2 medium, 30 low,
  `BEA-831`→`BEA-860` + `BEA-792`, `BEA-795`). Brought up inside the matching module as we go.
- **Stuck in progress** — `BEA-1013` (half-built on branch `sandypublic/bea-1013-task-dates`),
  `BEA-1012` (shipped, not closed), `BEA-488` (needs the owner on an iPhone).
